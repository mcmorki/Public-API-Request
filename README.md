Public-API-Request

You may use jQuery if you like.

Comments in the index.html file contain examples of the markup you'll need to add. So use the markup in those comments as a template. And keep in mind that altering the arrangement of the markup and the attributes used may break the styles or functionality.
Structure, style and CSS

Your finished project should match the general position and layout of the mockups. If you followed the arrangement and attributes of the template markup in the HTML comments, then the provided styles should accomplish this for you.
You are encouraged to experiment with things like color, background color, font, shadows, transitions and animations to make this project your own.
